Starting the week of January 21, the Tent team will host office hours online
once per week for an hour.

Each session will last one hour including a short talk, video, or demonstration
and be followed by a public question and answer period. These talks are aimed at
explaining the future and purpose of Tent to a wide audience from new users to
experienced developers. All are welcome to attend.

Please help us choose a time for next week's event
[here](http://www.doodle.com/g45d4exgcs8w96wg). We will vary the time week to
week to accomodate those in different time zones.
