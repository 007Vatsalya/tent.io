**Update**: The first Tent office hours will be held on Tuesday, January 22nd at
[3:00pm EST](http://everytimezone.com/#2013-1-22,480,6be). Watch this blog for
details on how to attend.

Starting the week of January 21, the Tent team will host office hours online
once per week for an hour.

Each session will last one hour including a short talk, video, or demonstration
and be followed by a public question and answer period. These talks are aimed at
explaining the future and purpose of Tent to a wide audience from new users to
experienced developers. All are welcome to attend. We will vary the time week to
week to accomodate those in different time zones.
