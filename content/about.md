Basics

  Tent is a datastore and communications protocol. It lets users store any kind of data and send that data to other users in real time. Just like other protocol-based services like email or the web, anyone can host their own server or write apps. Also like email, users can host their own Tent server or use a Tent hosting provider. 
  
  Tent stores data as `posts` on each server. Developers can use posts to represent any kind of information and use Tent to create services from microblogging to cloud file sync. 
  
How it works
  
  Every Tent user has a Tent server and many Tent apps. 

  Users create and view posts with apps. 

  Apps create posts which are stored on the user's server. 

  When a user creates a post, their server sends copies of the post to their followers' Tent servers.

  The user's server also stores copies of all posts it receives from other users.
  
What can you do with Tent?
  
  Tent is a generic data store and communications protocol. There is no limit on the type of data or apps it can support. Apps can be "social", collaborative, or meant for storing private information. Web apps, and native desktop and mobile apps for all operating systems are possible.

Why Tent?
  
  Tent is generic and decentralized. That means anyone can build any kind of app and host their own Tent server if they want. There are no limits or central authorities to censor or intermediate communication, invade privacy, or take control.
  
get started

  To get started with Tent, you need a Tent server. You can use a Tent host like [Tent.is](https://tent.is) or host [your own](https://github.com/tent/tentd-admin).
  
  Criteria for Tent servers

   - always on
   - storage capacity
   - lots of bandwidth
   - fast CPU
   - redundant infrastructure
