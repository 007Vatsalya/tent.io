    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tent is a new protocol for open, distributed social networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we believe&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="/blog/the-tent-manifesto"&gt;The Tent Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What makes Tent different?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tent is decentralized, not federated or centralized. Any Tent server can connect
to any other Tent server. All features are available to any server as
first-class citizens. Anyone can host their own Tent server. Tent servers can
also be run as Tor hidden services to create a social darknet for at-risk
organizers and activists. Anyone can write applications that connect to Tent in
order to display or create user content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relationships are between users, independent of their service providers, so
users take their data and relationships with them when they change Tent service
providers. Every user decides which other users can follow them and what
information will be shared with each of their followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;You are your memories and relationships&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use social networks to advertise our identities, communicate with friends,
families, co-workers, customers, and brands. The content we create in the form
of messages, uploaded media, and social graphs is not only valuable, it has come
to define each of us. This information, our relationships and our data needs to
be under our own control. When a user leaves a social service provider for any
reason, that user should be able to take their relationships, not just a copy of
their data, with them. Tent lets them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Planning for the Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tent supports extensible formats for post types and profile information. As
developers&amp;#39; needs change they are free to create new open formats for data
exchange. Tent is built on HTTPS, JSON and OAuth, each of which handles hundreds
of millions of transactions online each day. We designed Tent to grow and adapt
with its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Tent Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tent is not specifying the economics of an ecosystem. There will be many options
for users, from free to paid to self hosted, from ad-supported to
advertising-free, with providers that serve different market segments and
types of users. Since anyone can set up a Tent server or become a service
provider, niche needs should quickly be met, based on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many spectrums of need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class="table table-bordered"&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;technically experienced&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;inexperienced&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;rich&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;poor&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;ad tolerant&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;ad intolerant&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;verified&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;pseudonyms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;public&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;private&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;centralized&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;distributed&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Tent server implementation will be available as an open source
repository very soon. A hosted version for users unwilling or unable to host
their own will follow quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we encourage anyone with feedback or suggestions on the protocol or who is developing apps or services supporting Tent to add your services to the list in the GitHub repository via pull request. The
same goes for post-types and profile info-types: a community site will launch
soon, for now, use pull requests or reach out directly: &lt;a href="mailto:info@tent.io"&gt;info@tent.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about Tent in the &lt;a href="http://tent.io"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/docs/"&gt;developer documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Every user has the right to freedom of expression.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free speech is a necessary feature of all open societies. Speech can not be free
if communication is centralized or intermediated. Users must be able to say
anything to anyone they want on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Every user has the right to control their own data.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes who can access the data they create and how that data is later
used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Every user has the right to choose and change their social services providers.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes the right to negotiate reasonable terms of service collectively or
individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Every user has the right to host their own social services.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All social service providers must be treated equally, regardless of the number
of user accounts hosted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Every user has the right to communicate with any other user, regardless of their service provider.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No service provider shall interfere with the communications of any group or pair of users, or exclude any users on the basis of their service provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Every user has the right to take their data and relationships with them.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User relationships, like content, belong to the user. When changing service
providers, users have a right to transfer their relationships and data, and for
those relationships and data to be forgotten by the former provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Every user has the right to choose their own name.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pesudonyms, multiple accounts, and anonymity are an integral part of
communications and must not be restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Different users have different needs.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No single company, product, or platform can solve them all equally. The only
ecosystems capable of serving these needs are protocol-based and decentralized.
No user&amp;#39;s needs need be served poorly for others&amp;#39; needs to be served.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Communication must be decentralized.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only decentralized systems provide protection from outside control.
Decentralized systems limit the consequences of a single element failing.
Centralized systems by nature limit what can be shared and by whom. In
distributed systems, users have the power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Communication protocols must be standardized.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All communication from spoken language to digital packets requires a basic set
of shared ideas. Global communication systems require a greater degree of detail
to be interoperable. These standards must be available to and extensible by the
community of users in order to adapt to changing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The internet is capable of more.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closed and fragmented systems have stifled growth and change. An open social web
will create a new generation of tools, services, and content impossible in
today&amp;#39;s systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conversations change the world.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every revolution, whether political, scientific, or ideological began as
a conversation. The rules, conventions, and ethics of communication can be
determined only by those participating. Conversation is too important to trust
to any third party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re &lt;a href="/blog/introducing-tent"&gt;introducing Tent&lt;/a&gt;, an open protocol for distributed social networks.
Everyone controls what happens to their content.&lt;/p&gt;
