## Choose your host

Tent lets you control your data instead of handing it over to service and app providers. Just like email, you choose a Tent provider or can set up your own Tent server. Tent data and relationships are portable so you can change Tent providers easily at any time. Also like email, all Tent users are first class citizens, no matter what provider they use: you can communicate in real time with any user on any provider.

## Choose your apps

Tent lets you use many different applications to access the same data. Different apps that use the same types of data are swappable. You don't have to use the same application as your friends to communicate or share data with them.

## Control your life

Tent can hold all your data forever. It is designed to store all types of data and power every kind of app that can be imagined. If an app stops being developed, you can use another app with your old data. If a service provider shuts down or acts badly, you can change providers or set up your own server without missing a beat. Tent adapts with you.

## Developers

Like email and the web, Tent is protocol, not a platform. There is no central authority. No one can change the API terms of service or limit access. Build the apps you want, no one can shut you down. Tent is content agnostic, so almost any type of app can be powered by Tent.

Each user's Tent server is responsible for storing and transferring data, so many Tent apps are stateless and require no server infrastructure. Ship binaries on your favorite app store that connect directly to your users' Tent servers. Users can control their own data and you don't have to run or pay for servers. Because users' data is stored on their Tent servers, if your app doesn't "phone home", you never have to see or handle sensitive user data. Tent opens a world of possibilities for new types of apps beyond proprietary platforms.
