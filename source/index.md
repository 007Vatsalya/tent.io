### Choose any host

- service provider or self host
  - Choose a service provider or run your own Tent server
- change hosts and take your data with you
  - your data and relationships are portable and come with you when you move so you can change providers at any time
- communicate with any other Tent user, no matter the host
  - Tent is like email, you can communicate with any user on any provider seamlessly
    
### Choose any apps

- Interoperable/swappable
  - Use different apps to access the same data. You don't even have to use the same app as your friends to communicate with them
  
### Control your life

- There is no central authority or company to censor or spy on users or restrict developers
- Tent is meant to hold all your data forever and is content agnostic so it can hold new kinds of data. As your life evolves so will Tent.
  
### Developers

- no server infrastructure
  - outsource communication and persistence to users
- don't touch private user data
- no API terms of service - build the apps you want
